    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>
      Inhabited since prehistoric times, this
      <strong>Nabataean</strong> caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and
      the <strong>Dead Sea</strong> , was an important crossroads between
      Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half-carved into
      the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges.
      It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient
      <strong>Eastern</strong>
      traditions blend with<strong>Hellenistic</strong>
      architecture
